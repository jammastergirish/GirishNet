HELP
<p>
Well, this web site is quite easy to use, none of the links will open in a new browser window, 
so even when you click on 'The Web Site' next to the product, it will be in the main
frame.  You can view this site with MS Internet Exlorer 4 or higher, or Netscape
Navigator 4 or higher, but it looks best in Internet Explorer 4.  Everything that you can download from this site is free.If you
don't know where a linkpoints to, or what that button does, move your mouse over it, and look in the status bar. If 
for some reason the download does not work, or something on this site doesn't work, then
please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:download.problem@girishnet.globalnet.co.uk?subject=There is a Problem at GirishNet Download" onMouseOver="window.status='GirishNet Software - Problem'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">girishnet.software.problem@girishnet.globalnet.co.uk</a>.
<p>
<a href="search.htm" onMouseOver="window.status='The GirishNet Download Search Engine'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">Click here to search this site for a piece of software</a>
