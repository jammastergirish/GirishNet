This is the only version, I am not creating a second version of this guide, it isn't really a 
programme, it's just a Lotus Freelance Graphics presentation (so to use it you have to have freelance graphics 97+), 
which tells you about radio stations, and their frequencies, 
national and local. This guide is for everyone who 
listens to their radio, which is probably all of you.  This software was created by Girish Gupta.</p>
