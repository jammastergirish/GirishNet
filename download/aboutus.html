<p></CENTER>
Hi, I am Girish Gupta, the owner of this web site, GirishNet Download, I am 12 years old and I come from
the south east of England, you can visit my web site at <a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~girishnet" target="new window">
http://surf.to/GirishNet</a>, that is where the banner on the front page ('Home' in the contents)
points to.  If you want to tell me something just click on Contact on
the contents.  Have fun!  Oh yeah, and if you've been messing around, trying to make a piece
of software, or even a powerpoint or freelance presentation, anything, then send an e-mail, to
<a href="mailto:download@girishnet.globalnet.co.uk">download@girishnet@globalnet.co.uk</a>, with
the file attatched to the e-mail, and a short description of the software (or whatever it is).  I will
then send an e-mail, back to you, telling you if I have put your file, on the GirishNet download 
web site, I will put your name and your company, under the copyright bit, and in the short description
that I write I will say who the software was made by, and I will provide a link to your web site.
